# Greed

Some of us like the prospect of finding valuable treasure. The point
of greed is to be the greedy Indiana Jones you are, but IN SPAAACE!
The game is simple: gems (\*) will add one point, while asteroids (@)
take away one point. Special gems give 3 points. If you get 50 points,
you unlock free movement along the y axis.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have dotnet 6.0 or newer installed on your machine. Open
a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program
by running the following commands.

```
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code.
Start your IDE and open the project folder. Select "Run and Debug" on
the Activity Bar. Next, select the project you'd like to run from the
drop down list at the top of the Side Bar. Lastly, click the green
arrow or "start debugging" button.

## Project Structure

The project files and folders are organized as follows:

```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- Game                (source code folder)
+-- Program.cs          (program entry point)
+-- README.md           (general info)
+-- Unit04.csproj       (dotnet project file)
```
